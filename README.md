# 🧬 Skin Cancer Lesion Segmentation

A complete **deep learning project for skin lesion segmentation** using **PyTorch**, trained on the **HAM10000 dataset**, with deployment through **Streamlit** and **Gradio**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to segment skin lesions from dermoscopic images to support **skin cancer analysis**.
It implements and compares two advanced segmentation architectures and provides interactive interfaces for inference and visualization.

---

## 🧠 Models Used

* **Attention U-Net**
  Enhances segmentation accuracy using spatial attention on skip connections.

* **TransUNet Skip**
  CNN-based encoder with transformer-inspired bottleneck and skip connections.

---

## 📊 Dataset

* **HAM10000 (Human Against Machine)**
* Paired dermoscopic images and binary lesion masks
* Total samples: **5210**

  * Training: **4168**
  * Validation: **1042**

---

## 🔄 Preprocessing & Augmentation

Implemented using **Albumentations**:

* Resize to `256 × 256`
* Horizontal & Vertical Flip
* Random Rotation
* ImageNet Normalization
* Tensor Conversion

---

## 📉 Loss Function

A combined loss for robust segmentation:

```
Loss = Dice Loss + Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)
```

---

## 🏋️ Training Details

* Optimizer: Adam
* Learning Rate: `1e-4`
* Batch Size: `16`
